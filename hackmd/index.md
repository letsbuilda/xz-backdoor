## Jia Tan [github profile](https://github.com/JiaT75)
This is the account which was caught pushing a backdoor to the xz repository. 
The backdoor is quite intricate and advanced. To create such a well obfuscated backdoor
someone has to have a huge amount of technical expertise. 

**General Info**
- Account created: 2021-01-06
- Email on the account: jiat0218@gmail.com
- Username: "JiaT75", Full Name: "Jia Tan"

**Notable things**
- Full Name was "Jia Cheong Tan" at least up until 2022-10-06 (see https://web.archive.org/web/20221006184706/https://github.com/JiaT75)
  // todo: check out git log to get exact date of name change
- Profile Picture is has dimensions 255 by 255, which is odd. Maybe this can be used to identify the true original source of the image?

## Socketputppet accounts
It is generally suspected that whoever is behind this used several "Socketpuppet accounts" to pressure Lasse into merging patches/commits
that Jia made.
